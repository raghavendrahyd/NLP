# NLP
# =================

In this repo, I have explored various NLP models for various applications like text classification, text generation, text summarization, etc
#### 1. langchain [langchain_exploration.ipynb]: 
Experimented with LLMs like GPT3.5, Flan through langchain. Also tested the Agent functionaltiy of langchain, particularly chaining using LLM to summarize wikipedia and feedinto python REPL to perform mathematical operations.
#### 2. Fuzzy [gender_pred_through_fuzzy.ipynb]:
Analysed NYT best selling author data through NYSIIS phonetic algorithm on fuzzy package. Downstream used sBERT embeddings to compare clusters against clusters coming out from fuzzy.
