    "LSTMs are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), and were refined and popularized by many people in following work. Simple RNNs have exploding or vanishing gradients when dealing with long sequences, due to the nature of their recurrent neural network architecture. LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid these long-term dependency problems. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs are a kind of RNN and function similarly to traditional RNNs, its Gating mechanism is what sets it apart. In LSTMS, there are four interacting layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input gate: The input gate adds information to the cell state. It decides what new information we are going to store in the cell state\n",
    "- Forget gate: The forget gate removes the information that is no longer required by the model\n",
    "- Output gate: Output Gate at LSTM selects the information to be shown as output\n",
    "- Cell state: It carries the information across the different steps of the LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "While in the normal RNN cell, the input at a time-step and the hidden state from the previous time step is passed through a tanh activation function to obtain a new hidden state and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, at each time step, the LSTM cell takes in 3 different pieces of information -- the current input data, the short-term memory from the previous cell (similar to hidden states in RNNs) and lastly the long-term memory.\n",
    "The short-term memory is commonly referred to as the hidden state, and the long-term memory is usually known as the cell state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input gate**:\n",
    "Input gate functionality is achieved using 2 layers. The first layer can be seen as the filter which selects what information can pass through it and what information to be discarded. To create this layer, we pass the short-term memory and current input into a sigmoid function. The sigmoid function will transform the values to be between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that part of the information is unimportant, whereas 1 indicates that the information will be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second layer takes the short term memory and current input and uses tanh activation which will transform the values to be between -1 and 1. This layer will be used to scale the information that is passed through the input gate. The output of the input gate is the product of the two layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the input gate is represented as:\n",
    "first layer:\n",
    "$i_t = \\sigma(W_{xi}x_t + W_{hi}h_{t-1} + b_i)$\n",
    "second layer with tanh activation:\n",
    "$g_t = tanh(W_{xg}x_t + W_{hg}h_{t-1} + b_g)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the input gate is the product of the two layers:\n",
    "$c_t = i_t * g_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forget gate**:\n",
    "The forget gate is used to decide what information from the cell state we are going to throw away. The forget gate is similar to the input gate, except that it uses a sigmoid function to decide what information to throw away. The sigmoid function will transform the values to be between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that part of the information is unimportant, whereas 1 indicates that the information will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forget gate functionality is acheived by multiplying the incoming long-term memory by a forget vector generated by the current input and incoming short-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical representation of the forget gate:\n",
    "$f_t = \\sigma(W_{xf}x_t + W_{hf}h_{t-1} + b_f)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the forget gate is the product of the incoming long-term memory and the forget vector:\n",
    "$c_t = f_t * c_{t-1} + i_{input}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output gate**:\n",
    "The output gate is used to decide what information from the cell state we are going to output. The output gate will take the current input, the previous short-term memory, and the newly computed long-term memory to produce the new short-term memory/hidden state which will be passed on to the cell in the next time step.\n",
